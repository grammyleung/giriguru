# GiriGuru

[GiriGuru](http://giri.guru) is a project, of personal blog and maybe something else I'm not sure if I'm going to work on but basically will "giriguru" about personal stuff. It is absolutely free, [open source](https://github.com/grammyleung/giriguru/) and distributed under the MIT license.

GiriGuru works with MongoDB only, if you are interested in using it, you can apply for a free-tier MongoDB Atla Cluster, which I think enough for personal use, or host yourself. GiriGuru website can be hosted in an free-tier AWS server or your other choice as well.

GiriGuru is easily extendable, themable and configurable, it supports MongoDB data sources, AJAX & async callback loading.

GiriGuru functions properly on either PCs and mobile devices, and has a built in mobile theme for responsive design, that can easily be customized.

## Getting Started

### Something To Do First
To get started you need 3 things in your hand:
 1. A Linux or Windows Server, on which you can install Asp.NET Core runtime.
 2. MongoDB cluster, which can be applied from MongDB Atlas for free or install your own instance on your own server.
 3. Properly doing the configurations in source code and settings on webserver and database.
